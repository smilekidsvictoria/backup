title: "Creative Curriculum"
description: "At Kare-a-Lot we use Creative Curriculum, an evidenced based, learning curriculum for children ages birth through 5. It is used to set objectives for each of our classes, set the standards, write our lesson plans and classroom assessments. A curriculum is the what, why, how and why of a program. It guides in planning and offering excellent care and education to the children that it serves. It helps us to be intentional about the experiences that we offer while still having the flexibility to change the program to meet the needs and interests of the children in our care."
