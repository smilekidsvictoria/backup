description: "'Play helps children to achieve healthy and harmonious development. Especially in social and emotional development. It helps children establish their character while making responsible decisions and understanding differences between themselves and others. Children recognize and manage their emotions while they play with others. They learn how to show empathy and how to maintain positive relationships through play."
