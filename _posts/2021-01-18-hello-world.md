description: "'At Kare-a-Lot our PreK room serves children aged 4 to 5 years but not yet eligible for Kindergarten. We offer both a full day and half day program with flexible hours and rates to accommodate families with varied schedules. We provide a safe learning environment which stimulates natural development. Our program covers all areas of a childâ€™s development including social-emotional, language, cognitive and physical development. We have a weekly theme schedule with monthly visitors to enhance our themes. All of our activities are based upon our curriculum and our PreK Goals and Objectives. We provide all the food your child will need throughout the day including a breakfast snack, lunch and afternoon snack. A schedule is provided below that outlines our meal times as well as our academic/learning times."
