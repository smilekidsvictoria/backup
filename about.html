        <p>
        SMILEKIDS programs are designed to meet the individual child's basic developmental needs. These needs include: social, physical, emotional, intellectual, creative, and self-concept, while also responding to families' needs.
        

      <!--  <h4>2002 - LOREM IPSUM DOLOR</h4> -->
        Children’s interactions will not only consist of peer interactions but also with staff who are trained to pick up on children’s needs. Themes are used to develop the child's knowledge of their world, this will be integrated within the learning activity Centre whenever possible.</p>

      <!--  <h4>2007 - VIVAMUS HENDERIT</h4> -->
        <p>SMILEKIDS will support and supplement parental care for children in a quality setting.
        The program supports all children's right, regardless of their diverse abilities, to participate
        actively in a natural environment with their community. Our Caregiving philosophy is based on respect. Each child's natural pace and level of development is supported. Each child is encouraged to learn about their world through play and become a self-learner. Communication, cooperation, and respect between educators and parents are considered essential. This ensures consistent care and consideration of each child and family's unique needs.</p>

        <h4 class="lead"id="anchor2">Curriculum</h4>
        <p>
        The program of SMILEKIDS childcare is play-based. Play-based learning is a type of early
        childhood education. This program focuses on children and how they interact with their surroundings through play. Children learn best while playing. Their learning ability is innate and develops through a variety of play experiences. Children's play begins early on, and their competence is developed through it. Play-based learning is helping children experience the content of the curriculum while showing the value of learning in an engaging form. The curriculum starts from observation and support of children's play.
